# etextbook
Welcome to the etextbook wiki!
Yesterday I have downloaded a math school textbook in pdf format, for my 5 year old son, only to find out the only way to use it, is to print the pages so he can color it an put in answers.
The main goal for this project, is to create an open source text book, that students can fill in with text, drawings, color pictures, solve exercises etc.
Second goal would be to create a way to be able to share books or pages with friends, teachers and parents to get help, tutoring and marks. maybe even put stickers and share achievements in social websites.
So fill free to come and give me a hand in fulfilling a dream of a real virtual Eclassroom, that is simple for the user, yet, powerful to do some serious learning.

requirements:
RTL for hebrew is a must!!!

How do we do this?
I think, simply first stage - we take an html5 pdf reader and add a canvas on top with text/image editing capabilities, then we will see.
Fill free to post your comments, ideas criticism, what so ever in the wiki I've opened.
